# TicTacToe Finite State Machine 

A brief but robust demonstration of using a finite state machine to run a game of tic-tac-toe.

All of our states are defined in a union, which allows our game logic to be encapuslated in the function `transition`.


## Quick start

This project requires [Bun](https://bun.sh)


To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run main.ts
```

Enter a number to claim that space.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
